## Platforms govern by friction

They don’t ban you. They slow you down. They label you. They route you away from discovery.

## Why it matters

Visibility is power. If you can’t be found, you can’t organize, earn, or grow.

## The ask

Platforms should publish clearer policies. Creators should diversify distribution. Audiences should stop confusing “popular” with “true.”
