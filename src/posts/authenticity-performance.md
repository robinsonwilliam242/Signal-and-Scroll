## The new “authentic” has rules

Authenticity used to mean *less performance*. Online, it often means a different kind of performance: the right confessions, the right messiness, the right timing.

## Why it happened

Platforms reward **relatability** because it increases watch time. Brands reward **consistency** because it reduces risk. Put those together and you get a weird incentive: be real, but not too real.

## What it does to everyone

Creators feel trapped in an identity contract. Audiences learn to “read” people as products. And the rest of us start performing our own lives even when nobody asked.

## The move

If you’re a creator: protect private life. If you’re a viewer: stop treating access as a right. If you’re a platform: stop pretending this isn’t your business model.
