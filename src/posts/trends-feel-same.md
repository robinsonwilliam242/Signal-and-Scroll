## Engagement compresses culture

When the goal is retention, aesthetics converge. It becomes safer to imitate what already performs.

Trends move faster, but feel thinner. Everyone “gets it,” but nobody owns it.

## The hope

Small communities still generate weirdness. The future of originality might be smaller, not bigger.
