## Recommendation is not neutral

When a feed learns what you click, it also learns what to *stop showing you*. That quietly narrows your world.

## Taste is trained

You’re not discovering content in a vacuum. You’re being trained by repetition: the same pacing, the same aesthetics, the same emotional beats.

## How to fight it (a little)

Curate on purpose. Search instead of scrolling. Follow people who irritate you (slightly). And sometimes: log off long enough to remember what you liked before the feed told you.
