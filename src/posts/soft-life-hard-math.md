## The vibe is freedom

The spreadsheet is rent, healthcare, and a market that doesn’t care about your aesthetic.

## Why it spreads

Because it’s a protest against burnout. Because the job market is bleak. Because “soft life” is a fantasy of control.

## The honest version

Build softness *inside* reality: reduce expenses, increase skills, diversify income, protect your time.
